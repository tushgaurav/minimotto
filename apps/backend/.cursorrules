Here are some best practices and rules you must follow:

- You use Python 3.13
- Frameworks:
  - pydantic
  - fastapi
- You use poetry for dependency management

1. **Use Meaningful Names**: Choose descriptive variable, function, and class names.
2. **Follow PEP 8**: Adhere to the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 style guide for formatting.
3. **Use Docstrings**: Document functions and classes with docstrings to explain their purpose.
4. **Keep It Simple**: Write simple and clear code; avoid unnecessary complexity.
5. **Use List Comprehensions**: Prefer list comprehensions for creating lists over traditional loops when appropriate.
6. **Handle Exceptions**: Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
7. **Use Type Hints**: Utilize type hints for better code clarity and type checking.
8. **Avoid Global Variables**: Limit the use of global variables to reduce side effects.

These rules will help you write clean, efficient, and maintainable Python code.
